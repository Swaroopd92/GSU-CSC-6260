CSC8221: Optical/Wireless networks
Homework 3

1.	Compare the following concepts (RWA: Routing and Wavelength Assignment, RSA: Routing and Spectrum Allocation):
	a) RWA in in wavelength routed networks vs. RWA in waveband switching networks
	b) RSA in wavelength routed networks vs. RSA in FlexGrid networks

2.	Compare the advantages and disadvantages of link protection, path protection and segment protection. 

3.	Comparing to Protection schemes, why Restoration schemes can be more efficient in terms of resource utilization. 

4.	Explain the basic idea of dedicated protection and shared protection. 
	Compare dedicated link protection with dedicated path protection, which one is more practical and why?
 
5.	In Optical Burst Switching (OBS) Networks, one key issue is to resolve the burst contention.
	(a) Explain when burst contention will happen.
	(b) Provide at least 3 methods that can be employed to reduce data loss due to the burst contention, and briefly explain the idea of each method. 

6.	In OBS networks, the control packet is sent in advance before the corresponding data burst by an offset time. 
	Answer the following questions: 
	(a) Why is the offset time required?
	(b) Assume we divide the burst into two classes: Class A, and Class B. We assign a larger offset time for the burst in Class A.
	Explain why then the bursts in Class A have higher priority in the channel usage.
	In other words, the bursts in Class A have less chance to be dropped due to contention.  

7.	(a). What is the maximum data rate that can be supported on a 10 MHz noiseless channel if the channel uses eight-level digital signals?
	(b). What signal to noise ratio (in dB) is required to achieve 10 Mbps through a 5MHz channel?
